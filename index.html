        <h2>Intraoral Scanners</h2>
        <div class="image-placeholder"><img src="img/8fTRIOSpod.png" alt="intraoral scanners"></div>
        <p>
            Intraoral scanners are advanced digital tools that capture detailed 3D images of a patientâ€™s mouth. By projecting LED light onto the teeth and gums, the scanner records how the light reflects back, creating a highly accurate digital model in real time.
This replaces the need for messy, uncomfortable traditional impressions using molding material. The 3D models are immediately transferred to dental laboratories, accelerating the process of fabricating crowns, veneers, aligners, and other dental devices. This not only improves accuracy but also enhances the patient experience by reducing discomfort and the number of appointments.

        <h2>3D Printing</h2>
        <div class="image-placeholder"><img src="img/impressora-3d-na-odontologia.jpg" alt="3d"></div>
        <p>
            3D printing in dentistry works hand-in-hand with intraoral scanners. Once a digital model is created, 3D printers can manufacture precise physical replicas or custom dental appliances.

This technology allows the production of dental crowns, bridges, orthodontic aligners, surgical guides, dentures, and even tooth replicas with remarkable speed and accuracy. It reduces the dependency on external labs and can produce devices in-house, often within the same day, providing faster solutions for both dentists and patients.

        <h2>Management Software</h2>
        <div class="image-placeholder"><img src="img/Dental_Appointment.png" alt="managemtn"></div>
        <p>
         Dental management software is an essential tool for the efficient operation of modern dental clinics. It simplifies and automates administrative tasks such as appointment scheduling, patient records, financial management, and inventory control.Beyond just administration, some platforms offer marketing tools, automatic reminders for patients, and real-time data access from any device. This not only saves time but also enhances patient communication, reduces errors, and improves the overall organization of the clinic.</p>

        <h2>Digital Radiography</h2>

        </div>

        <p>
            Digital radiography has revolutionized dental imaging by replacing traditional X-rays with faster, safer, and more detailed digital images. Instead of film, it uses sensors that capture the image and send it directly to a computer.

Dentists can adjust brightness, contrast, and zoom in for a clearer diagnosis, and patients are exposed to significantly less radiation. Portable X-ray devices have further improved flexibility, allowing images to be taken directly in the treatment chair without moving the patient.

        <h2>Needle-Free Electronic Anesthesia</h2>
        <div class="image-placeholder"><img src="img/ignesiz-anestezi-uygulamasi-4.webp" alt=""></div>
        <p>
            This innovative technology eliminates the fear associated with needles during dental procedures. Using a pressurized jet injection system, the anesthetic is delivered through a tiny openingâ€”much smaller than that of a needleâ€”directly into the tissue.

The process is nearly painless, quick, and less invasive, which reduces patient anxiety and discomfort. This method also provides more precise distribution of anesthesia, minimizing side effects and enhancing recovery.
